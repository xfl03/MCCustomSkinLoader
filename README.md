## To Skin Server Owner  
CustomSkinLoader is designed for loading from any server, which makes the mod complex.  
It's not a good idea to refer to CustomSkinLoader's source code to develop your own skin mod.  
It's recommended to use CustomSkinLoader for your server directly.  
Furthermore, you can add your server to 'Default Load List'.  
You can also use 'ExtraList' which makes it easier for users to add your server into load list.
